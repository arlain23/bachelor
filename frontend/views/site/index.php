			<p class="sub-title"> Goal of the project: </p>
			<p class="project-description goal"> The goal of the project is to investigate possibilities of increasing the accuracy of numerical modeling and parameterization of the brain blood vessel system, affected by limited resolution and artifacts in magnetic resonance angiography.
			<p class="sub-title">Project hyphotesis: </p>
			<ol>
				<li class="project-description">one can build a continuous model of blood vessels in large- and medium-scale diameter ranges by attaching synthesized, image-texture and/or SWI vessel radius/density described trees of thinner vessels to the terminal branches of the thick-vessel tree</li>
				<li class="project-description">modified level-set segmentation of 3D images can make geometrical modeling robust to imaging artifacts, thus more accurate. The blood flow inside vessels is taken into account. The model and image processing/analysis algorithms are validated, and their accuracy evaluated with the use of physical and numerical test objects.</li>
